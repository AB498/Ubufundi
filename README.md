### Ubufundi
Source code for Android Recipies Book 5Th Edition with some custom changes. This repo hosts self contained, compilable pieces of android/Java code to explain some concept. The relevant code is highlighted for fast reference.

Android is a huge world and it is very easy to forget specific things you did to make things work over time. This repo is my go to place to find quick hints to get the job done. If somebody else finds it useful, even better.

The book is not complete yet, but I do document things as I go.
Head to our Wiki page https://github.com/blikoon/Ubufundi/wiki and see what's in store already.

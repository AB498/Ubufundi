####App1.1 : Working with styles and themes

* Define your styles in the /res/values/styles.xml file of your project.
* Reuse them on UI components as shown in the res/layout/activity_main.xml file(Example style = "@style/FormCheckBox")
* Themes are like styles in that you define them in /res/values/styles.xm 
* Themes are used either on Activity context or Application context.
